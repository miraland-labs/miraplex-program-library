# miraplex-redrop

This package contains the redrop contract SDK code. Derived and adapted from Metaplex foundation gumdrop

## Developing

In order to update the generated SDK when the rust contract was updated please run:

```
yarn api:gen
```

NOTE: at this point this only generates the IDL json file but later will generate TypeScript
definitions and SDK code as well, derived from that IDL.
